Date: May 5th 2020

## Overview
This repository was prepared in partial fulfilment of the Practical Machine Learning Course which comprises one of the five courses necessary for the Data Science: Statistics and Machine Learning Specialization offered by Johns Hopikins University through Coursera.

This project challenges candidates to use data from accelerometers on fitness devices of 6 participants to predict the manner in which they did the exercise. This is the "classe" variable in the training set. Candidates may use any of the other variables to predict with, but ultimately must create a report describing how the model was built, cross validated, what one thinks the expected out of sample error is, and why particular choices were made along the way. Candidates must also utilise the prediction model to predict 20 different test cases.

A major element of this coursework project requires candidaes to create a Github repository with for the R markdown and compiled HTML file describing your analysis.
